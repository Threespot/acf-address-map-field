# Advanced Custom Fields: Address/Map Field
## Customized

A fork of [chrisgoddard/acf-address-map-field](https://github.com/chrisgoddard/acf-address-map-field) that provides
some custom functionality/features. Thanks @chrisgoddard for the awesome original!

For general information see the original project's [README](https://github.com/chrisgoddard/acf-address-map-field).

### Differences from Original

 - Moving the marker will do reverse geocoding to fill in the fields
 - If there's existing data from the built-in ACF Google Maps field, it'll be imported through geocoding
 - General structural changes of the JS
 - Removed support for the beta ACF5 :-/
